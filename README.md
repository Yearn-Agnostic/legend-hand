#Yfiagswap Diamond Hand 

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

#Setup

```shell
Run :
npm install to install project dependencies
npm run compile to compile contract
npm run deploy:bscTestnet : deploy to bsc testnet
npm run verify:bscTestnet : verify smart contract on bsc testnet scan
npm run test : run smart contract test on local hardhat network

#Config
